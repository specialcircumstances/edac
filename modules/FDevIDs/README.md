IDs returned from the FDev Companion API
====

Notes
----

- These collections are incomplete - most notably PowerPlay-specific items are missing from outfitting.csv.
- Player-specific items are deliberately omitted from outfitting.csv - i.e. those items returned from the API with category/slotname "bobblehead"/"BobbleNN", "decal"/"DecalN" and "paintjob"/"PaintJob".
- The values in the "name" fields in these files are as shown in the in-game commodity market, outfitting and shipyard. These are not the same in all cases as the text values returned by the Companion API or used over [EDDN](https://github.com/jamesremuscat/EDDN/blob/master/schemas/shipyard-v1.0.json#L55).
